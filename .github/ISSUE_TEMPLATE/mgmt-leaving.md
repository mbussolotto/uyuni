General template for tasks to be done by Team Leads for leavers from the SUSE Multi-Linux team.

# Leaving date

**Official:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Last work day:** YYYY-MM-DD

# Some days before the member's last work day

Team Lead to handle the following tasks:

- [ ] **General SUSE Procedure:** Review the [team members leaving the company](https://sites.google.com/suse.com/resources/team-leader-quick-links), in particular the `Information Guide when a Team Member is Leaving`. Those documents contain information about everything that needs to be returned, and things to be done by the team lead and the team member (not just hardware!)
- [ ] **Exit interview:** Conduct an [exit interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_interview) and store the notes at [Confluence](https://confluence.suse.com/display/SUSEMANAGER/Exit+Interviews)
- [ ] **Hardware:** Evaluate if the leaver jas access to something special which also needs to get transferred to another person (SSH access to a server, permissions to special pages on wikis, Confluence, resources in the cloud, VMs, Raspberry Pi hardware, etc.)
- [ ] **Bugzilla:** Remind the **leaver to remove all ["watches"](https://bugzilla.suse.com/userprefs.cgi?tab=email) in Bugzilla before leaving**
- [ ] **Bugzilla:** Review the [responsibles for the bugzilla team accounts](https://confluence.suse.com/display/IAM/5.+UCS+Role+Model+and+Entitlements+Management#id-5.UCSRoleModelandEntitlementsManagement-Bot/Serviceentitlements) and nominate a new one person if needed
- [ ] **Packages:** Run `OUSER=<LEAVER>; osc search -i ${OUSER}; osc -A https://api.suse.de maintainer -U ${OUSER}` (replace `<LEAVER>` with the leaver's username), and if the leaver is a bugowner of any package, look for a new bugowner (ideally a group, not a single person, home projects can be ignored)
- [ ] **Code:** Consider any code stored in personal accounts and create forks accordingly (e.g. in GitLab)
- [ ] **Credentials:** Consider any credentials known only to that leaver (e.g. for mailing lists) and share
- [ ] **Mailing lists:** Transfer mailing list administration to someone else (usually only needed when a Team Lead is leaving)
- [ ] **Content:** Consider any content that could be present in e.g. https://w3.suse.de or Google Drive, and maybe should be stored it permanently (e.g. recordings, slides, moving them to Google Drive)
