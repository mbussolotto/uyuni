# TODO some days before

Add more tasks if needed.

- [ ] Review the content of the channel files. Reminder: the new SLFO extensions are managed by the Git workflow.
- [ ] Lock the branches
  - [ ] [Edit the branch protection rule](https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/settings/branch_protection_rules/80278870) for the `Manager-5.2` branch  on `SUSE/spacewalk`.
    - [ ] Ensure that the checkbox `Restrict who can push to matching branches` is marked
    - [ ] Rename the `Branch name pattern` from `BRANCH-TO-BE-LOCKED-FOR-MU-52` to `Manager-5.2` and save the rule
  - [ ] [Edit the branch protection rule](https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/settings/branch_protection_rules/80278870) for the branch `Manager-5.2` on `SUSE/uyuni-tools`.
    - [ ] Ensure that the checkbox `Restrict who can push to matching branches` is marked
    - [ ] Rename the `Branch name pattern` from `BRANCH-TO-BE-LOCKED-FOR-MU-52` to `Manager-5.2` and save the rule
- [ ] Send an email to galaxy-devel@suse.de informing that the branches `SUSE/spacewalk:Manager-5.2` and `SUSE/uyuni-tools:Manager-5.2` are locked, and adjust the topic on the slack channel [#team-multi-linux-manager](https://suse.slack.com/archives/C02D78LLS04)
- [ ] Ask the Doc Squad to submit a Pull Request with the doc package update to the Git repository in Galaxy, and ask them to warn the translators so they can start their work. A Merge Request for the [documentation.suse.com repository](https://gitlab.suse.de/susedoc/docserv-external-tree-suma) should get created a few days before the release
- [ ] After the branch freeze, ask [Orion](https://suse.slack.com/archives/C02DDMY6R0R) to prepare the PR for the code translations. If nobody from Orion is available, ask @parlt91. They will add us as reviewers.
- [ ] Increase `web.version` in `web/conf/rhn_web.conf` (`x.y.z+1`) in `Manager-5.2` branch
  - [ ] Check that the sed that replaces the default tag for SUSE Multi-Linux Manager in the [push.sh](https://github.com/SUSE/uyuni-tools/blob/Manager-5.2/push.sh) script in [uyuni-tools](https://github.com/SUSE/uyuni-tools) specifies the same version you added in `web.version`. If the value is outdated, update it with a PR for [uyuni-tools](https://github.com/SUSE/uyuni-tools). For example, see the [PR done](https://github.com/SUSE/uyuni-tools/pull/43) for fixing the default pull tag after the release of SUSE Manager 5.0.2.
- [ ] Check if the migration paths exist for both the main database and report database, if they are needed (more at https://confluence.suse.com/display/SUSEMANAGER/Maintenance+Update+procedure)
- [ ] Check if schema migration directories exist between older and newer SUSE Manager version (more at https://confluence.suse.com/display/SUSEMANAGER/Maintenance+Update+procedure)
- [ ] Push changes to `Manager-5.2` branch
- [ ] Create the JIRA ticket, with placeholders for the IDs (this is needed by ION squad too)
- [ ] Confirm that the PR for the documentation is merged, and translators warned
- [ ] Merge the PR for the translations with the option `Merge pull request`
- [ ] Ask the Ion Squad to promote salt and bundle versions where needed (not needed for MUs without salt/client tools). Remember that we have an **[agreement on how and when to submit salt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140wx3yvFk1klXiHMzBI-cKf4s-Z2nzycGWS2KC5qUvA)**.
  - [ ] When the promotion is done, ask Ion to submit classic salt only to `SUSE:SLE-15-SP7:Update:Products:MultiLinuxManager52:Update`. Tell them to add to the submit message the ID of the Jira ticket in the form `ijsc#MSQA-$ID`, for example, `ijsc#MSQA-808`
  - [ ] remember that relengs submit the bundle to the 5.2 client tools while the classic salt submission is handled by the Ion squad, and that for SLE 16 and SL Micro 6.2, the client tools are now managed via the new Git workflow, therefore bundles need to be submitted using git PRs.
  - [ ] Add all the IDs (and notes, if any), to the JIRA ticket, and ping the Maintenance Team at [#discuss-susemamanager-maintenance](https://app.slack.com/client/T02863RC2AC/C02DEF2U0E5)
- [ ] Quick review changelogs with `tito-wrapper`, and request changes if needed
- [ ] Check all the relevant [5.2 CI tests for the 5.2 version](https://ci.suse.de/view/Manager/view/Manager-5.2/): everything should be green, or otherwise submission must be approved by the RRTG

# TODO during the submission window

Add more tasks if needed (for example, asking Maintenace to change the channel definitions).

- [ ] Check all the relevant [5.2 CI tests for the 5.2 version](https://ci.suse.de/view/Manager/view/Manager-5.2/): everything should be green, in particular the [acceptance testsuite](https://jenkins.mgr.suse.de/job/manager-5.2-dev-acceptance-tests/) or otherwise submission must be approved by the RRTG
- [ ] Tag everything with `tito tag`. Do **NOT** tag if the version has not been already bumped in `web/conf/rhn_web.conf` (`web.version.uyuni`), as requested in one of the previous points.
- [ ] Check that the Jenkins synchronization jobs ([manager-5.2-releng-2obs](https://ci.suse.de/view/Manager/view/Manager-5.2/job/manager-5.2-releng-2obs/) and [manager-5.2-uyunitools-2obs](https://ci.suse.de/view/Manager/view/Manager-5.2/job/manager-5.2-uyunitools-2obs/)) successfully mirrored the GitHub changes to the internal Gitea server (src.suse.de). In the new workflow, these jobs no longer create Submit Requests in OBS; instead, they automatically push code commits directly to the relevant Gitea repository (SUSE_Multi-Linux_Manager-packages)
- [ ] Prepare the submissions:
  - [ ] For Git-managed packages, open a PR on Gitea. Specifically there are two scripts called `submit-packages-with-git`and `submit-mlm-clienttools-slmicro6.sh`to submit general package updates and client tools packages respectively.
  - [ ] For the old OBS workflow, submit with `mu-massive-task` or `patch-creator`. For any new packages that will be added to the codestreams, fetch the groups what will maintain them (one per package) and document this at the release card.
- [ ] For submitting to **SL Micro 6.2** the client tools and salt bundle, remember that you can't use `patch-creator`; instead use the script `submit-slmicro6_clienttools` that will explain step by step what to submit and how.
- [ ] Add all the IDs (and notes, if any), to the JIRA ticket, and ping the Maintenance Team at [#discuss-susemamanager-maintenance](https://app.slack.com/client/T02863RC2AC/C02DEF2U0E5)
- [ ] Once autobuild approves all MRs, create the `Manager-5.2-MU-X.Y.Z` branch and push it.
- [ ] Before unlocking the branches `SUSE/spacewalk:Manager-5.2` and `SUSE/uyuni-tools:Manager-5.2`, consider PRs for merge that became ready during the branch freeze looking for the ["merge-candidate" label](https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Amerge-candidate) or ["merge-candidate" label for uyuni-tools](https://github.com/SUSE/uyuni-tools/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Amerge-candidate) or ping reviewers to take care of it.
- [ ] Unlock the branches
  - [ ] [Edit the branch protection rule](https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/settings/branch_protection_rules/80278870) for the `Manager-5.2` branch  on `SUSE/spacewalk`.
    - [ ] Ensure that the checkbox `Restrict who can push to matching branches` is marked
    - [ ] Rename the `Branch name pattern` from `Manager-5.2` to `BRANCH-TO-BE-LOCKED-FOR-MU-52` and save the rule
